# Ama

## About 
Ama is a first-person psychological thriller that revolves around 2 main playable characters, an older sister (Elena Alfonso) and her younger brother (Danielo Alfonso), who must find a way to survive an intruder invading their home while alone in the night.

This game is heavily inspired by and revolved around Filipinx culture. It will reference the immigrant experience in Canada, and explore the nuanced dynamics of families and relationships. 

## Notes 
This project is in its VERY early stages of development, but expect there to be several new updates within the next coming months!
It is currently being built with Unity and version controlled with Github/Azure DevOps. 
## Coming Soon 
We will soon be creating and linking our YouTube, Discord, Twitter, and Instagram accounts in promotion for this game.
